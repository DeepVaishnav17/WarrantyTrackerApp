# Warranty Tracker for Home Appliances

## Project Overview

**Warranty Tracker for Home Appliances** is a startup-style web application designed to help users manage and track warranties for their home appliances. The application provides automated reminders for warranty expiration and allows users to maintain service records for their appliances.

### Problem Statement
Most people lose track of warranty information for their appliances, leading to missed opportunities for free repairs and replacements. Our solution provides a centralized platform to manage warranty information and receive timely reminders.

### Solution
A web-based warranty management system that allows users to:
- Store appliance information with warranty details
- Receive automated reminders before warranty expiration (planned feature)
- Track service history and maintenance records
- Get notifications through dashboard alerts (in development)
